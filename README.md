<h1 align="center"> Amazon Price tracker. </h1>

<p>
The Amazon Price Tracking System is a project that allows users to track the price of their favorite products on Amazon. With this system, users can set up alerts to be notified when the price of a product drops to a certain level, so they can make their purchases at the best possible price.

## How it works

<p>
The system works by scraping Amazon's website for product information and prices. It then stores this data in a database and updates it regularly. Users can search for products they want to track and add them to their watchlist. The system will then monitor the price of these products and send notifications to the user when the price drops below the set threshold.
